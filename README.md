# Password-Safety-Checker

Not sure if the password you are using is safe or not?

This Python script helps you check whether the password you are using has even been hacked or not.
It does so by accessing the pwnedpasswords api which stores the data of all the passwords leaks that have ever happened and keeps count of which password has been hacked how many times.

To check the safety of your password, just run this script from the terminal entering your password as an argument.
It will tell you the number of time your password has been hacked.
If the number is 0, congratulations, you've chosen a strong password!
